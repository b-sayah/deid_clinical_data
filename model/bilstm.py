    This is the standard way to define your own network in PyTorch. You typically choose the components
    (e.g. LSTMs, linear layers etc.) of your network in the __init__ function. You then apply these layers
    on the input step-by-step in the forward function. You can use torch.nn.functional to apply functions
    such as F.relu, F.sigmoid, F.softmax. Be careful to ensure your dimensions are correct after each step.

    You are encouraged to have a look at the network in pytorch/vision/model/net.py to get a better sense of how
    you can go about defining your own network.

    The documentation for all the various components available to you is here: http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html

        We define a recurrent network that predicts the NER tags for each token in the sentence. The components
